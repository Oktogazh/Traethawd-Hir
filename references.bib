	abstract = {The increasing number of experimental studies on second language (L2) processing, frequently with English as the L2, calls for a practical and valid measure of English vocabulary knowledge and proficiency. In a large-scale study with Dutch and Korean speakers of L2 English, we tested whether {LexTALE}, a 5-min vocabulary test, is a valid predictor of English vocabulary knowledge and, possibly, even of general English proficiency. Furthermore, the validity of {LexTALE} was compared with that of self-ratings of proficiency, a measure frequently used by L2 researchers. The results showed the following in both speaker groups: (1) {LexTALE} was a good predictor of English vocabulary knowledge; 2) it also correlated substantially with a measure of general English proficiency; and 3) {LexTALE} was generally superior to self-ratings in its predictions. {LexTALE}, but not self-ratings, also correlated highly with previous experimental data on two word recognition paradigms. The test can be carried out on or downloaded from www.lextale.com.},

	abstract = {Pseudowords are letter strings that look like words but are not words. They are used in psycholinguistic research, particularly in tasks such as lexical decision. In this context, it is essential that the pseudowords respect the orthographic statistics of the target language. Pseudowords that violate them would be too easy to reject in a lexical decision and would not enforce word recognition on real words. We propose a new pseudoword generator, {UniPseudo}, using an algorithm based on Markov chains of orthographic n-grams. It generates pseudowords from a customizable database, which allows one to control the characteristics of the items. It can produce pseudowords in any language, in orthographic or phonological form. It is possible to generate pseudowords with specific characteristics, such as frequency of letters, bigrams, trigrams, or quadrigrams, number of syllables, frequency of biphones, and number of morphemes. Thus, from a list of words composed of verbs, nouns, adjectives, or adverbs, {UniPseudo} can create pseudowords resembling verbs, nouns, adjectives, or adverbs in any language using an alphabetic or syllabic system.},

This article attempts to tackle the problem of determining a meaningful score for this type of test. Such a score should contain correction for guessing as well as for participants’ response style. Three possible methods are discussed, but none of these measures appear to apply this type of correction. Signal Detection Theory is applied and a new, more accurate index is suggested.

The system can be used in educational systems when we interpret student's answer to an item as a match between the student and the item. In this way we can easily dynamically estimate the skill of students and difficulty of items. We provide a systematic overview of different variants of the Elo rating system and their application in education. We compare the Elo rating system to alternative methods and describe a specific case study (an adaptive practice of geography facts) to illustrate the application of the Elo rating system in education. We argue that the Elo rating system is simple, robust, and effective and thus suitable for use in the development of adaptive educational systems. We provide specific guidelines for such applications.},

The study involved 619 Russian-speaking children aged 3-7 years (M=67.80, {SD}=13.73), 48.3\% of whom were boys. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary test-{IV} (form A) was used in the study. The article analyzed differences between children of different age groups from 3.5 to 7.5 years with a step of six months. It was found that there were significant differences in the ceiling items, the total number of errors, and the raw scores in children of different age groups. No gender differences were found. An analysis of the children's performance of series and individual tasks showed that the complexity of the tasks was unevenly distributed. As a result, the methodology in its current form does not work quite as it was intended by its creators: Moscow preschoolers go through a lot of series and spend a lot of time on the implementation of the methodology, which is due to differences in the lexical systems between Russian and English. In this regard, the tool is not optimal for use in its current form; theauthors of the article propose to design a local tool for the assessment of the receptive vocabulary in Russian preschoolers.},

The latest advances in technology make adaptive learning possible, which has the potential to provide students with high-quality learning benefit at a low cost. A key component of an adaptive learning system is a recommendation system, which recommends the next material (video lectures, practices, and so on, on different skills) to the learner, based on the psychometric assessment results and possibly other individual characteristics. An important question then follows: How should recommendations be made? To answer this question, a mathematical framework is proposed that characterizes the recommendation process as a Markov decision problem, for which decisions are made based on the current knowledge of the learner and that of the learning materials.

The primary aim of this pilot study was to design and initially validate the Context-Aligned Two Thousand Test ({CA}-{TTT}), following open research practices. The {CA}-{TTT} is a test of written form–meaning recognition of high-frequency vocabulary aimed at beginner-to-low intermediate learners of French at the end of their fifth year of secondary education. Using an argument-based validation framework, we drew on classical test theory and Rasch modeling, together with correlations with another vocabulary size test and proficiency measures, to assess the {CA}-{TTT}’s internal and external validity. Overall, the {CA}-{TTT} showed high internal and external validity. Our study highlighted the decisive role of the curriculum in determining vocabulary knowledge in instructed, low-exposure contexts. We discuss how this might contribute to under- or over-estimations of vocabulary size, depending on the relations between the test and curriculum content. Further research using the tool is openly invited, particularly with lower proficiency learners in this context. Following further validation, the test could serve as a tool for assessing high-frequency vocabulary knowledge at beginner-to-low intermediate levels, with due attention paid to alignment with curriculum content.},

While {ORF} is a well-established measure of foundational literacy, assessing it typically requires one-on-one sessions between a student and a trained rater, a process that is time-consuming and costly. Automating the assessment of {ORF} could support better literacy instruction, particularly in education contexts where formative assessment is uncommon due to large class sizes and limited resources. This research is among the first to examine the use of the most recent versions of large-scale speech models for {ORF} assessment in the Global South.We find that the best performing model, Whisper V2, with no additional fine-tuning, produces transcriptions of Ghanaian students reading aloud with a Word Error Rate of 10.3. When these transcriptions are used to produce fully automated {ORF} scores, they closely align with scores generated by expert human raters, with a correlation coefficient of 0.98. These results were achieved on a representative dataset (i.e., students with regional accents, recordings taken in actual classrooms), using a free and publicly available speech with no additional fine-tuning. This model’s strong performance on real-world classroom data, combined with its accessibility and simplified implementation, suggests potential for scaling {ORF} assessment in lower-resource, linguistically diverse educational contexts.},

Specifically, I show that many of the early pioneers of {AI} were cognitive scientists who also made pioneering and impactful contributions to the field of education. These researchers saw {AI} as a tool for thinking about human learning and used their understanding of how people learn to further {AI}. Furthermore, I trace two distinct approaches to thinking about cognition and learning that pervade the early histories of {AI} and education. Despite their differences, researchers from both strands were united in their quest to simultaneously understand and improve human and machine cognition. Today, this perspective is neither prevalent in {AI} nor the learning sciences. I conclude with some thoughts on how the artificial intelligence in education and learning sciences communities might reinvigorate this lost perspective.},

In particular, the emphasis in the proposed conception is on ontology, reference, and causality, whereas current validity theory focuses on epistemology, meaning, and correlation. It is argued that the proposed conception is not only simpler but also theoretically superior to the position taken in the existing literature. Further, it has clear theoretical and practical implications for validation research. Most important, validation research must not be directed at the relation between the measured attribute and other attributes but at the processes that convey the effect of the measured attribute on the test scores.

In these studies, the technologies are: a) Online Learning [{OL}]; b) Blended Learning [{BL}] and c) Flipped Classrooms [{FC}]. Treatments were compared to standard face-to-face classroom instruction ({CI}) on three dependent measures analysed separately to produce 77 achievement measures in the first meta-analysis, 21 attitude/satisfaction measures in the second, and 22 studies of self-efficacy in the third. Achievement data yielded a statistically significant, moderate effect size (i.e., g+= 0.44) in favor of the combined {OL}, {BL} and {FC} approaches versus {CI}, although {OL} showed only a small positive effect versus {CI}. Attitude yielded a non-significant effect size comparing {CI} with technology-supported strategies (g+= 0.12). Interestingly, self-efficacy produced a significant and moderate average random effect size of g+ = 0.45. Perhaps the most impactful finding of this analysis is related to improved performance of {BL}/{FC} when contrasted with {OL}, yielding significantly positive differences in all three measures. This confirms that improved outcomes are the result of better pedagogy, not the mere presence of technology. Finally, self-efficacy was found to be meaningfully improved when using {BL}/{FC}. This is the first meta-analysis with this target population implicating self-efficacy. These two outcomes offer important implications for institutions regarding the future design of instructional delivery for both pre- and in-service teachers.},

	shorttitle = {The cortical column},
	abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A ‘column’ now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term ‘column’ also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

Some layers have long-range excitatory lateral connections suggesting interactions between columns. Similar patterns of connectivity exist in all regions but their exact role remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a network model composed of columns and layers that performs robust object learning and recognition. Each column integrates its changing input over time to learn complete predictive models of observed objects. Excitatory lateral connections across columns allow the network to more rapidly infer objects based on the partial knowledge of adjacent columns. Because columns integrate input over time and space, the network learns models of complex objects that extend well beyond the receptive field of individual cells. Our network model introduces a new feature to cortical columns. We propose that a representation of location relative to the object being sensed is calculated within the sub-granular layers of each column. The location signal is provided as an input to the network, where it is combined with sensory data. Our model contains two layers and one or more columns. Simulations show that using Hebbian-like learning rules small single-column networks can learn to recognize hundreds of objects, with each object containing tens of features. Multi-column networks recognize objects with significantly fewer movements of the sensory receptors. Given the ubiquity of columnar and laminar connectivity patterns throughout the neocortex, we propose that columns and regions have more powerful recognition and modeling capabilities than previously assumed.},

	shorttitle = {A Thousand Brains},
	abstract = {"For all we hear of neuroscience's great advances, the field has generated more questions than answers. We know that the brain combines sensory input from all over your body into a single perception, but not how. We think brains "compute" in some sense, but we can't say what those computations are. We believe that the brain is organized as a hierarchy, with different pieces all working collaboratively to make a single model of the world. But we can explain neither how those pieces are differentiated, nor how they collaborate. Neuroscientist and computer engineer Jeff Hawkins argues that it's so hard to answer questions about the brain because our basic picture of how the brain works is wrong. In A Thousand Brains, Hawkins takes a radically new approach to the brain, with stunning implications. Hawkins' proposal, called the Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence, is that your brain is organized into thousands upon thousands of individually computing units, called cortical columns. These columns all process information from the outside world in the same way, and each builds a complete model of the world. But because every column has different connections to the rest of the body, each has a unique frame of reference. Your brain sorts out all those models by conducting a vote. The fundamental job of the brain, therefore, is not to build a single thought, but to manage the thousands of individual thoughts it has every moment. With this powerful new framework, Hawkins is able to reassess some of neuroscience's most stubborn problems, like why pain needs to be painful to be useful, how we can understand that our perspective of a thing changes as we move around it, and why we might be conscious but individual pieces of our body aren't. And once you understand how the brain works, it is a lot easier to make one yourself. Hawkins is, above all, an engineer, and A Thousand Brains outlines how a new understanding of intelligence could lead to truly intelligent {AI}. Hawkins explores how we might create machines that can learn on their own, why we need not fear superintelligent systems, and how human and machine intelligence may someday merge. Combining cutting-edge theoretical neuroscience with an ambitious program for tomorrow's digital minds, A Thousand Brains heralds a revolution in the study of intelligence. It is a big-think book, in every sense of the word"--},

Grid cells use a hexagonally symmetric code to organize spatial representations and are the likely source of a precise hexagonal symmetry in the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. Humans navigating conceptual two-dimensional knowledge showed the same hexagonal signal in a set of brain regions markedly similar to those activated during spatial navigation. This gridlike signal is consistent across sessions acquired within an hour and more than a week apart. Our findings suggest that global relational codes may be used to organize nonspatial conceptual representations and that these codes may have a hexagonal gridlike pattern when conceptual knowledge is laid out in two continuous dimensions.},

By integrating ascending inputs with extensive top-down activity, this layer likely provides critical information regulating how the perception of sensory inputs is reconciled with expectation. This is accomplished by sorting, directing, and integrating the complex network of excitatory inputs that converge onto L1. These signals are combined with neuromodulatory afferents and gated by the wealth of inhibitory interneurons that either are embedded within L1 or send axons from other cortical layers. Together, these interactions dynamically calibrate information flow throughout the neocortex. This review will primarily focus on L1 within the primary sensory cortex and will use these insights to understand L1 in other cortical areas.},

	abstract = {The concept of the cortical column refers to vertical cell bands with similar response properties, which were initially observed by Vernon Mountcastle's mapping of single cell recordings in the cat somatic cortex. It has subsequently guided over 50 years of neuroscientific research, in which fundamental questions about the modularity of the cortex and basic principles of sensory information processing were empirically investigated. Nevertheless, the status of the column remains controversial today, as skeptical commentators proclaim that the vertical cell bands are a functionally insignificant by-product of ontogenetic development. This paper inquires how the column came to be viewed as an elementary unit of the cortex from Mountcastle's discovery in 1955 until David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's reception of the Nobel Prize in 1981. I first argue that Mountcastle's vertical electrode recordings served as criteria for applying the column concept to electrophysiological data. In contrast to previous authors, I claim that this move from electrophysiological data to the phenomenon of columnar responses was concept-laden, but not theory-laden. In the second part of the paper, I argue that Mountcastle's criteria provided Hubel Wiesel with a conceptual outlook, i.e. it allowed them to anticipate columnar patterns in the cat and macaque visual cortex. I argue that in the late 1970s, this outlook only briefly took a form that one could call a 'theory' of the cerebral cortex, before new experimental techniques started to diversify column research. I end by showing how this account of early column research fits into a larger project that follows the conceptual development of the column into the present.},

While head direction cells can be found throughout the brain, spatial tuning outside the hippocampal formation is often non-specific or conjunctive to other representations such as a reward. Although the precise mechanism of spatially selective firing activity is not understood, various studies show sensory inputs, particularly vision, heavily modulate spatial representation in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit. To better understand the contribution of other sensory inputs in shaping spatial representation in the brain, we performed recording from the primary somatosensory cortex in foraging rats. To our surprise, we were able to detect the full complement of spatially selective firing patterns similar to that reported in the hippocampal-entorhinal network, namely, place cells, head direction cells, boundary vector/border cells, grid cells and conjunctive cells, in the somatosensory cortex. These newly identified somatosensory spatial cells form a spatial map outside the hippocampal formation and support the hypothesis that location information modulates body representation in the somatosensory cortex. Our findings provide transformative insights into our understanding of how spatial information is processed and integrated in the brain, as well as functional operations of the somatosensory cortex in the context of rehabilitation with brain-machine interfaces.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly in the last decade, driven primarily by progress in the scale of deep-learning systems. Despite these advances, the creation of intelligent systems that can operate effectively in diverse, real-world environments remains a significant challenge. In this white paper, we outline the Thousand Brains Project, an ongoing research effort to develop an alternative, complementary form of {AI}, derived from the operating principles of the neocortex. We present an early version of a thousand-brains system, a sensorimotor agent that is uniquely suited to quickly learn a wide range of tasks and eventually implement any capabilities the human neocortex has. Core to its design is the use of a repeating computational unit, the learning module, modeled on the cortical columns found in mammalian brains. Each learning module operates as a semi-independent unit that can model entire objects, represents information through spatially structured reference frames, and both estimates and is able to effect movement in the world. Learning is a quick, associative process, similar to Hebbian learning in the brain, and leverages inductive biases around the spatial structure of the world to enable rapid and continual learning. Multiple learning modules can interact with one another both hierarchically and non-hierarchically via a "cortical messaging protocol" ({CMP}), creating more abstract representations and supporting multimodal integration. We outline the key principles motivating the design of thousand-brains systems and provide details about the implementation of Monty, our first instantiation of such a system.

Although this approach is connected to the traditional study of languages, it differs enough in its specific conclusions about the structure and in its specific conclusions about the structure of language to warrant a name, "generative grammar." Various deficiencies have been discovered in the first attempts to formulate a theory of transformational generative grammar and in the descriptive analysis of particular languages that motivated these formulations. At the same time, it has become apparent that these formulations can be extended and deepened.The major purpose of this book is to review these developments and to propose a reformulation of the theory of transformational generative grammar that takes them into account. The emphasis in this study is syntax; semantic and phonological aspects of the language structure are discussed only insofar as they bear on syntactic theory.},

The results showed that L2 knowledge variables were invariably strong correlates of L2 reading comprehension. Language-general variables such as working memory and metacognition were, on the other hand, only weakly correlated with L2 reading comprehension. Of the two companion proficiency variables, namely, L2 listening comprehension and L1 reading comprehension, the former showed a much stronger correlation with L2 reading comprehension. In sum, these results indicated that L2 reading comprehension is much more strongly associated with L2 knowledge rather than language-general, cognitive or metacognitive variables or the long-assumed general reading abilities indicated by L1 reading comprehension.

By doing so, we examined various L2 proficiency models, writing models, and hypotheses, particularly the core-periphery model proposed by Hulstijn (2015). To this end, a total of 103 retrieved studies contributed 377 effect sizes based on 112,475 independent participants. The results showed that L2 reading and speaking achievement had strong average correlations with L2 writing performance, whereas L1 writing performance had a medium correlation with it. L2 linguistic knowledge (grammar, vocabulary, transcription, decoding) had more medium to strong effects on L2 writing performance than language-general cognitive skills and motivational constructs, which had only weak effects.

Two research questions were addressed: (1) what is the overall relationship between L2 listening and all its components collectively? and (2) what is the relationship between L2 listening and each of its components? Regarding (1), results from 118 studies (533 correlations) showed a significant, moderate relationship between L2 listening and its components overall (r = .446). Regarding (2), L2 listening was more strongly related to linguistic knowledge (grammar and vocabulary) than cognitive ability and affective features (aptitude, metacognitive awareness, working memory, attitude, and motivation), with anxiety (another affective feature) located in between. These results suggest how various components relate to L2 listening.

	abstract = {Le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues - Apprendre, Enseigner, Évaluer ({CECR}, parfois désigné aussi par l'abréviation {CECRL}) est un document publié par le Conseil de l'Europe en 2001, qui définit des niveaux de maîtrise d'une langue étrangère en fonction de son savoir-faire dans différents domaines de compétence. Ces niveaux constituent désormais la référence dans le domaine de l'apprentissage et de l'enseignement des langues dans de nombreux pays. En France, ils sont repris dans le code de l'éducation comme niveaux de compétence en langues vivantes étrangères attendus des élèves des écoles, collèges et lycées.
L'innovation principale du {CECR} consiste en un système et une échelle d'évaluation de la maîtrise d'une langue sur la base des objectifs de compétence. Ceci est donc indépendant de la langue traitée et de l'organisme évaluateur, contrairement aux autres systèmes d'évaluation qui sont souvent propres à un pays, voire à un organisme, et généralement applicables à une seule langue. Pour ces raisons, de nombreux organismes évaluateurs alignent leurs échelles d'évaluation sur les niveaux du {CECR}, ou pour le moins fournissent une grille de conversion.},

	abstract = {Modern online education has the capacity to provide intelligent educational services by automatically analyzing substantial amounts of student behavioral data. Knowledge Tracing ({KT}) is one of the fundamental tasks for student behavioral data analysis, aiming to monitor students' evolving knowledge state during their problem-solving process. In recent years, a substantial number of studies have concentrated on this rapidly growing field, significantly contributing to its advancements. In this survey, we will conduct a thorough investigation of these progressions. Firstly, we present three types of fundamental {KT} models with distinct technical routes. Subsequently, we review extensive variants of the fundamental {KT} models that consider more stringent learning assumptions. Moreover, the development of {KT} cannot be separated from its applications, thereby we present typical {KT} applications in various scenarios. To facilitate the work of researchers and practitioners in this field, we have developed two open-source algorithm libraries: {EduData} that enables the download and preprocessing of {KT}-related datasets, and {EduKTM} that provides an extensible and unified implementation of existing mainstream {KT} models. Finally, we discuss potential directions for future research in this rapidly growing field. We hope that the current survey will assist both researchers and practitioners in fostering the development of {KT}, thereby benefiting a broader range of students.},

We present a pseudoword generator that improves on current methods. It allows for the generation of written polysyllabic pseudowords that obey a given language’s phonotactic constraints. Given a word or nonword template, the algorithm can quickly generate pseudowords that match the template in subsyllabic structure and transition frequencies without having to search through a list with all possible candidates. Currently, the program is available for Dutch, English, German, French, Spanish, Serbian, and Basque, and, with little effort, it can be expanded to other languages.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {To validate an interpretation or use of test scores is to evaluate the plausibility of the claims based on the scores. An argument-based approach to validation suggests that the claims based on the test scores be outlined as an argument that specifies the inferences and supporting assumptions needed to get from test responses to score-based interpretations and uses. Validation then can be thought of as an evaluation of the coherence and completeness of this interpretation/use argument and of the plausibility of its inferences and assumptions. In outlining the argument-based approach to validation, this paper makes eight general points. First, it is the proposed score interpretations and uses that are validated and not the test or the test scores. Second, the validity of a proposed interpretation or use depends on how well the evidence supports the claims being made. Third, more-ambitious claims require more support than less-ambitious claims. Fourth, more-ambitious claims (e.g., construct interpretations) tend to be more useful than less-ambitious claims, but they are also harder to validate. Fifth, interpretations and uses can change over time in response to new needs and new understandings leading to changes in the evidence needed for validation. Sixth, the evaluation of score uses requires an evaluation of the consequences of the proposed uses; negative consequences can render a score use unacceptable. Seventh, the rejection of a score use does not necessarily invalidate a prior, underlying score interpretation. Eighth, the validation of the score interpretation on which a score use is based does not validate the score use.},

Our findings highlight distinct patterns: when considering stated preferences, both risk tolerance and impatience exhibit a decline with age. Higher risk tolerance is associated with higher impatience, and this relationship strengthens with age in the financial domain. In contrast, our analysis of elicited measures uncovers a different dynamic. Specifically, risk tolerance tends to increase with age, while age exhibits no significant influence on impatience. Furthermore, individuals endowed with higher risk tolerance tend to demonstrate lower levels of impatience, irrespective of their age.},
